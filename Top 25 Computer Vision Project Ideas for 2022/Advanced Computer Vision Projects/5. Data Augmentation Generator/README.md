# Data-augmentation-of-image-using-keras

This repository contains the code of ImageDataGenerator class present in Keras. Data augmentation is often helpful to create more dataset of particular class for training the model. First the ImageDataGenerator class is used on single image of cat showing the various diffirent modification we can make to image using function in order to make augemnt our dataset. Later it is used on CIFAR10 dataset for training.

Following ways to augment data are demonstrated.

* Rotation
* Width and Height Shifts
* Brightness
* Shear transformation
* Zoom
* Channel Shift
* Horizontal and Vertical Flips

Later Data normalization, rescaling and preprocessing are done. Then used in training model.
